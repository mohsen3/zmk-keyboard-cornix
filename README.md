- [x] ec11 encoder, since v2.2
- [x] no-SD image, since v2.3
- [x] rgb since v3


### about RGB

Cornix shield has 2 RGB LEDs on each side (4 LEDs total), controlled by WS2812 via SPI.

The RGB LED indicator module is **now enabled by default** in this repository! The LEDs provide visual feedback for:

**Battery Status Indicators:**
- Green: 80-100% battery
- Yellow: 50-79% battery
- Orange: 20-49% battery
- Red: 0-19% battery
- Blue: Currently charging

**Connection Status Indicators:**
- Solid color: Connected to host
- Slow blink: Disconnected/Searching for connection
- Fast blink: Pairing mode

**LED Configuration:**
- Brightness: 64/255 (default, optimized for battery life)
- LED count: 2 per side
- Pin mapping: Left (P0.24), Right (P0.13)

To adjust brightness or disable LEDs, edit `boards/shields/cornix_indicator/cornix_indicator.conf` and modify `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BRIGHTNESS` (0-255).

**Note:** LED indicators consume additional power. If you experience reduced battery life, you can disable them by commenting out the `shield: cornix_indicator` lines in `build.yaml`.

## Performance Tuning

This firmware has been optimized for minimal latency. Here's what has been tuned:

### Current Optimizations

**Matrix Scanning:**
- Poll interval: 2ms (5x faster than default 10ms)
- Location: `boards/arm/cornix/cornix.dtsi:26`

**Debouncing:**
- Press debounce: 1ms (3x faster than previous 3ms)
- Release debounce: 5ms (balanced for stability)
- Location: `boards/arm/cornix/Kconfig.defconfig:26-28`

**Bluetooth Connection:**
- Min interval: 6ms (7.5ms actual)
- Max interval: 9ms (11.25ms actual)
- Connection latency: 10 (previously 30)
- Location: `boards/arm/cornix/cornix_*_defconfig`

**Processing:**
- Work queue priority: -2 (higher priority for faster HID)
- BLE buffer sizes: optimized for 251 bytes
- USB HID polling: 1ms (1000Hz)

### Fine-Tuning Options

If you want to experiment further, you can adjust these settings:

**For even lower latency (may reduce stability):**
```kconfig
# In cornix_*_defconfig files:
CONFIG_ZMK_KSCAN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS_MS=0    # No debounce (risky - may cause double-taps)
CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL_PREF_LATENCY=0      # Zero latency mode (uses more power)
```

**If experiencing key chatter or double-taps:**
```kconfig
# In cornix_*_defconfig files:
CONFIG_ZMK_KSCAN_DEBOUNCE_PRESS_MS=2    # Slightly more stable
CONFIG_ZMK_KSCAN_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE_MS=7  # More stable release
```

**For better battery life at cost of latency:**
```kconfig
# In cornix.dtsi:
poll-interval-ms = <5>;  # Less aggressive scanning

# In cornix_*_defconfig:
CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL_PREF_MAX_INT=12    # Longer intervals
CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL_PREF_LATENCY=30    # More power efficient
```

### Additional Enhancement Suggestions

Consider these ZMK features not yet enabled in this repo:

1. **NKRO (N-Key Rollover)** - For gaming or fast typing
   ```kconfig
   CONFIG_ZMK_HID_REPORT_TYPE_NKRO=y
   ```

2. **Combo performance** - Faster combo detection
   ```kconfig
   CONFIG_ZMK_COMBO_MAX_COMBOS_PER_KEY=16
   CONFIG_ZMK_COMBO_MAX_KEYS_PER_COMBO=4
   ```

3. **Deep sleep optimization** - Disable if you want instant wake
   ```kconfig
   CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=n  # Disable sleep for instant response
   ```

## --Bootloader Recovery Instructions--

-- The original RMK firmware removed the SoftDevice, so before flashing `zmk.uf2`, you need to restore the SoftDevice first. For specific steps, please refer to [bootloader/README.md](./bootloader/README.md). --

Since v2.3 this board' flash partitions has updated, removed SD (reducing sd partitionsize size from 150K to 4K), so You can flash firmware directly.

> You may need to reset fw by reset.uf2 from ealier version

> You can rollback to stock firmware by flash orgin uf2 file, backup files under rmkfw/

> - ZMK Configuration: https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup

### Step 2: Add Cornix Shield to Your Project

After initializing your zmk-config repository, follow the steps in the next section to integrate the Cornix shield.

## How to Add Cornix Shield to Existing ZMK Project

For users with existing zmk-config, add this repository dependency via west.yml and pull the latest version via west update:

### 1. Modify west.yml

Edit the `config/west.yml` file, add to the `manifest/remotes` section:

```yaml
remotes:
  - name: zmkfirmware
    url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
  - name: cornix-shield
    url-base: https://github.com/hitsmaxft
  - name: urob
    url-base: https://github.com/urob
```

Add to the `manifest/projects` section:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: zmk
    remote: zmkfirmware
    revision: main
    import: app/west.yml
  - name: zmk-keyboard-cornix
    remote: cornix-shield
    revision: main
  - name: zmk-helpers
    remote: urob
    revision: main
```

### 2. Update Dependencies

```bash
west update
```

### 3. Configure Build

Edit the `build.yaml` file, add:

> [!NOTE]
> 1. If you are using (default) cornix without dongle, choose "cornix_left", "cornix_right" and "reset".
> 2. If you are using cornix with dongle, choose "cornix_dongle". "cornix_left_for_dongle", "cornix_right" and "reset".
> 3. Add "cornix_indicator" shield to enable RGB led light. It consumes much more power, use at your own risk.

```yaml
include:
  # Use cornix with dongle
  - board: cornix_dongle
    shield: cornix_dongle_eyelash dongle_display
    snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
    artifact-name: cornix_dongle

  - board: cornix_ph_left
    # shield: cornix_indicator
    artifact-name: cornix_left_for_dongle

  # Use cornix without dongle
  - board: cornix_left
    # shield: cornix_indicator
    artifact-name: cornix_left

  - board: cornix_right
    # shield: cornix_indicator
    artifact-name: cornix_right

  - board: cornix_right
    shield: settings_reset
    artifact-name: reset
```

### 4. Build Firmware

Use your preferred method to build

- no need to recovery the sd since 2.3
- falsh reset.uf2 both side of cornix
- flash left and right uf2 files
- reset both side at the same time.

### 5. Flash Firmware

Flash the generated `.uf2` files to the corresponding microcontroller:
- Left half: `build/left/zephyr/zmk.uf2`
- Right half: `build/right/zephyr/zmk.uf2`

## Build This Project Locally (Without west.yaml Dependency)

If you prefer to build this project locally without adding it as a dependency in your west.yaml, you can use the ZMK_EXTRA_MODULES cmake argument.

### Prerequisites

1. Have a working ZMK development environment set up
2. Clone this repository to a local directory

### Build Steps

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hitsmaxft/zmk-keyboard-cornix.git
   ```

2. **Configure your ZMK build with the extra module**:
   
   Edit your `.west/config` file and add the cmake argument under the `[build]` section:
   
   ```ini
   [build]
   cmake-args = -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES=/full/absolute/path/to/zmk-keyboard-cornix
   ```
   
   Replace `/full/absolute/path/to/zmk-keyboard-cornix` with the actual absolute path where you cloned this repository.

3. **Build the firmware**:
   ```bash
   west build -b cornix_e73 -- -DSHIELD=cornix_main_left
   west build -b cornix_e73 -- -DSHIELD=cornix_right
   ```

This method allows you to use the Cornix shield without modifying your existing ZMK configuration's west.yaml file.
